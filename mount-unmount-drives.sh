# that the drives will be mounted under /run/media/$USER/ (a common location for 
# external devices in many Linux distributions).
# Requires zfz

# Function that gives fzf dropdrown of all drives found with lzblk and propts 
# for a name of the drive to be mounted at /run/media/UserName/driveName
# Note: If you have files whose paths point to this drive, mkae sure to set
# the drive name to same name otherwise your files won't load.
